*Marketing Research, 13th Edition* presents a clear and comprehensive introduction to the field, with a strong focus on methodologies and the role of market research in strategic decision making. Employing a unique macro-micro-macro approach, the text begins with a broad overview of market research and its place within—and value to—an organization, before zooming in to detail the granular view of the research process. Step-by-step explanations cover the latest methodologies and current practices, highlighting advanced techniques as well as their limitations and potential benefits, followed by a high-level discussion of research applications.

An emphasis on real-world processes is underscored by end-of-chapter cases, allowing students to apply what they’ve learned in the context of real-life examples covering a broad range of products and organizations. This practical approach promotes engagement while building essential critical analysis, interpretation, and decision-making skills, preparing students to recognize potential research applications, alternatives where they exist, and the quality of research at hand. By pulling together market intelligence, strategy, theory, and application, this text helps students build a deep understanding while retaining the big picture perspective.
